### Approved Base models:

The starting model for the competition should be an open base model without instruction-tuning. Examples of licenses we’ll accept are [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html "MIT"), [Apache 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 "Apache 2"), [BigScience RAIL](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license "BigScience RAIL"). We’re also happy to discuss other licenses on a case by case basis, for example per community interest we’ll accept the [LLAMA 2 community license agreement](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE "LLAMA 2 community license agreement") if you’ve requested and been approved for a [download link](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/ "download link").
