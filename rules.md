The competition aims to ensure fair evaluation and reproducible results. To achieve this, you must comply with the following guidelines  

* Submissions must be reproducible on a test server. Submissions, along with all associated code and data, must be released under an MIT or Apache 2 license after the competition ends.  
<br>
* The target model should not be subject to adjustments and fine-tuning (retraining) that significantly reduce the accuracy of the model.  
<br>
* Submissions must not use copyrighted or proprietary data, code, or closed-source content. Use of data or content that violates a service agreement or another company's trade secrets is not permitted.  
<br>
* Teams can use open source code and libraries as long as they provide proper attribution.  
<br>
* Using an external implementation without attribution, or copying another team's implementation, will result in disqualification.  
<br>
* A team can consist of no more than three people. Teams must self-certify that none of their team members are participating on another team in this competition.  
<br>
* Each team can make one submission per day for the duration of the competition. We rank the best performing teams and update the results daily for a final system evaluation.  
<br>
* Organizers and those associated with the competition are not eligible to participate.  
<br>
* Even if you don't violate any of the above rules, you may be disqualified if you act in a way that violates trust or exploit the community.
