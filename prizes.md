For each of the two hardware categories, we will select winning groups for the top three positions: 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place.

 * The first place winning group will receive a $5,000 cash prize,  
 * The second place group will receive $2,500, and  
 * The third place group will receive $1,000.

Additionally, we will present two student awards per hardware category, granted to the highest-ranking groups outside the top 3 positions and composed entirely of matriculating students in a university or graduate program. Each student award recipient group will receive $500. Winners will be announced on the competition website as well as during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS.

The two first place winning teams will be invited to give a 30-minute presentation each during the in-person workshop at NeurIPS, and all members of those teams will be offered a chance to co-author the report-out paper on this competition.
